* The exception handler in on-client-connect should provide some way to identify
the client connection: preferably the requesting IP address should be written to
the log file, but Mosh currently does not provide a way to get this information
from a socket.  Support would also need to added to (spells network) library.

Example exception handler for a 404:

Error: #(struct:exn:fail:filesystem file-size: file not found:
"/home/amoe/./favicon.ico" #<continuation-mark-set>) in connection
127.0.0.1:20154.

* Handle mapping between URIs and servlet hierarchies, like
(my-web-app entry-point)

* Vulnerable to path traversal.

The session code uses throwing a procedure and procedure EQ? to allow stuff.
This doesn't work.  Since each procedure necessarily knows its own index,
suggest deriving a condition type, and using that instead.
